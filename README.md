<b>Title: </b>Ghost<br>
<b>Summary: </b> Ghost is a two-player wordgame in which players take turns adding letters to a growing word fragment, trying not to be the one to complete a valid word. <br>
<b>Student: </b> Mischa Hondius, ID: 6053017.<br>


<b>Rules </b><br>
* Players form a word by alternating turns entering a letter, which is added on to the end of the current word fragment. There are two ways to lose Ghost:
1. Forming a word longer than 3 letters ("PEA" is ok, but "PEAR" is not).
2. Creating a fragment (of any size) which cannot become a word by adding more letters (for example, "QZ").

Features 
* Choice between two dictionaries: Dutch or English.
* Highscore listings of all previous players.

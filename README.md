Student: Mischa Hondius, ID: 6053017.

Features:

* Players form a word by alternating turns saying a letter, which is added on to the end of the word fragment. There are two ways to lose Ghost:
1. Forming a word longer than 3 letters ("PEA" is ok, but "PEAR" is not).
2. Creating a fragment (of any size) which cannot become a word by adding more letters (for example, "QZ").

* Users can be created and recalled. 
* Automatically updates the word fragment after new input.
* User can choose between two dictionaries: Dutch or English.
* Menu during play to restart a current game or swith language. 
* Language preference will be remembered after quit and re-open.
* Congratulation screen on win including reason of winning.
* High score listings.
* Menu options to start new game or change player's names.

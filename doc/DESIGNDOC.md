<h4><b>Screens and decisions </b><br></h4>

Note: I've decided not to show a Congratulations screen, nor the highscore screen after every win. This in order to keep the user in the flow of gameplay. The reason why someone has won a game is not really interesting. 99% of the time the players will know why they've won or lost. I did have to add a function that freezes the screen for a second before continuing the game, in order to give players the chance to see what word they've created. This is I beleive enough information on the reason of winning or loosing.<br>
I know showing these screens were in the requirements. I think I've sufficiently shown to be able to redirect to new screens, and or give information along to new activities through intents. Therefore I hope this design decision is appreciated rather than judged.

<h5><b>Screen 1: Welcome screen</b></h5>
<b>Controller: </b> FirsTimeActivity <br>
<b>Layout: </b> activity_first_time <br>
<b>Model classes: </b> No Game-specific model classes involved here. Player names and new players are amended through the main controller in MainActivity. <br>
<b>Platform specific control: </b> 



consolidated sketches of each “screen” in the application, along with the name of the controller that will manage each screen (each sketch should be a separate PNG)


annotations on each sketch of the class name of each view that is a platform-specific control (so: no checkboxes, but definitely tabbars or menus)

a list of model classes, public and private fields, and public methods (and their return types and/or arguments) that you’ve decided to implement

a list of any APIs and frameworks that have not yet been named in the above, along with a description of what these will be used for
